# Machine_Vision_for_Roadsigns
This project focuses on collecting data from various internet sources and annotating it using Roboflow annotate.The machine learning models were created using Roboflow_V2, Detectron2 and Yolo V5.
The Trained model is then uploaded into a raspberry pi(with a camera module). The output roadsign recognition video feed can be obersed from an external screen.
